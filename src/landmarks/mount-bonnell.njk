          <p>Mount Bonnell, also known as Covert Park, is a prominent point alongside the Lake Austin portion of the Colorado River in Austin, Texas. It has been a popular tourist destination since the 1850s. The mount provides a vista for viewing the city of Austin, Lake Austin, and the surrounding hills. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1969</p>
          
          <p>Mt. Bonnell has served as a popular attraction since the 1830s. Considered a more rural part of Austin then, picnics and outings were popular at the site, as well as entertainment, such as when Hazel Keyes, trailed by her monkey, slid down a cable stretched from the top of Mt. Bonnell to the south bank of the lake below in 1898. Today thousands of visitors ascend the 106 stone stairs to the summit to take in sweeping panoramic views of the lake, downtown, and the western hills of Austin.</p>
